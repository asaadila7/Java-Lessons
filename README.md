# Java-Lessons
Slides and speaker notes for Java fundamentals workshops

## Notes
The first lesson was on String manipulation because it's fun without being too hard. You can change it up and start with workshop 2 if you want (although you may have to adapt it to include some of the introductory slides from workshop 1).

Some of the replit exercises have already been completed by me with my students. I will try to go back and clean them up sometime.
